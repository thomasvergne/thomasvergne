### Hey, it's Thomas

I'm a programming language designer and developer with almost 4 years of experience. I'm working on a new programming language called [**Plume**](https://github.com/plume-lang/plume). I often use **Haskell** to write my programming languages' compilers and interpreters.

I love kinds of stuff like **functional programming**, **type theory**, **compilers**... I love sharing my knowledge so I plan to write an article series about creating and designing a programming language from scratch on my future blog.

- I'm looking for language feedback for [**Plume**](https://github.com/plume-lang/plume)
- I'm currently creating a [**Zed extension for Cabal**](https://github.com/thomasvergne/zed-cabal-extension)
- I recently wrote an article on [**learning and capturing the essence of Haskell**](https://dev.to/sisypheus/learning-haskell-5g3m)
- I'm also currently learning and dealing with [**row-polymorphism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_polymorphism)

### Languages and tools I deal with daily

![Languages and tools](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=haskell,ocaml,c,js,wasm,latex,git,docker&theme=light)

- Haskell and OCaml for implementing algorithms and compilers
- C, Javascript, and WASM for language target or VM writing
- Latex for formalizing my ideas
- Docker and Git for deploying my projects
